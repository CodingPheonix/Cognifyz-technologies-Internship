# Project: Server-Side Rendering and Form Handling with Node.js

This project demonstrates the basics of server-side rendering, form handling, and dynamic web applications using modern web development technologies.

## Summary
This hands-on task involves creating a simple web application that includes:
- A home page rendered using the EJS template engine.
- A form on the home page to collect a **username** and **email** from users.
- A backend built with Node.js and Express to process form submissions.
- A dynamically rendered response page displaying the submitted form details.

### Key Features
1. **Server-Side Rendering**: The home page is dynamically rendered using EJS.
2. **Form Submission**: Users can submit a form that collects their details.
3. **Dynamic Response**: The server processes the submitted data and renders a response page displaying the information.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Template Engine**: EJS
- **Middleware**: Body-parser
- **Development Tool**: Nodemon
