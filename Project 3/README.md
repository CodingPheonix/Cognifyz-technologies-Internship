# Task 3: Advanced CSS Styling and Responsive Design

## Objective:
Enhance the CSS styling of a webpage and make it fully responsive. This task involves creating a more complex layout with multiple sections, experimenting with advanced CSS properties (such as transitions and animations), and utilizing a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) to ensure a consistent and responsive user interface.

## Steps:
1. Create a more complex layout with multiple sections.
2. Experiment with CSS properties for advanced styling (e.g., transitions, animations).
3. Integrate a CSS framework like Bootstrap for a responsive design.

## Setup and Application:

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Project 3** directory:
    ```bash
    cd Project 3
    ```

2. Install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the local server and you can view the project in your browser at `http://localhost:5174/` (or the port provided in your terminal).

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure that all sections of the webpage are properly styled and responsive across different screen sizes.
- Use CSS animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
- Make use of Bootstrap classes to quickly build a consistent, mobile-first design.
