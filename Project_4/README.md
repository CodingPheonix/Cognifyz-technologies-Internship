# Complex Form Validation and Dynamic DOM Manipulation

Welcome to the **Cognifyz Project 4**: *Where Data Meets Intelligence*. This project focuses on extending form validation with advanced rules, implementing dynamic updates to the DOM, and integrating client-side routing for a smoother user experience.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance user interaction and usability by:

1. **Enhancing Form Validation**: Adding complex validation rules, such as password strength checks.
2. **Dynamic DOM Updates**: Providing real-time feedback to users by dynamically updating the DOM based on user interactions.
3. **Client-Side Routing**: Implementing seamless navigation without requiring full page reloads.

## Features
- A simple form on the front page that accepts a username and password.
- Real-time password strength validation with dynamic visual feedback.
- Smooth and responsive user interface enhanced by client-side routing.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingPheonix/Cognifyz-technologies-Internship.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd Project_4
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` or the port specified by your development server.

## How It Works
- **Form Validation**: The password input field provides feedback on strength (e.g., weak, medium, strong) based on predefined criteria such as length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Feedback appears dynamically as the user types, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
- **Client-Side Routing**: Navigating between pages (or sections) happens smoothly without reloading, making the application feel faster and more responsive.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS3**: To style the application dynamically.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To implement functionality, validation, and dynamic DOM updates.
- **Node.js**: For dependency management and development environment.
- **npm**: For managing project dependencies and scripts.
- **React-router-dom** : To implement routing.
