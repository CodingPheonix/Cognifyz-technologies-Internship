# Task 6: Database Integration and User Authentication

## Cognifyz - Where Data Meets Intelligence

This project focuses on integrating a database and implementing user authentication to ensure secure data handling. Below is a summary of the objectives and steps to set up and run the project.

## Objective
- Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to store and retrieve form data.
- Implement user authentication on the server.
- Secure API endpoints with authorization checks.

## Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodingPheonix/Cognifyz-technologies-Internship.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Project_6
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies for the Frontend**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash

   npm install
   nodemon main.js
   ```

## Features
- **Database Integration:** A database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) is used to handle form data storage and retrieval.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and session management for users.
- **API Security:** Authorization checks protect sensitive endpoints.
